This tool is built using LangChain, and Streamlit, and is designed to automate and personalize cold outreach for B2B service companies.

How It Works:
Input: The user enters the URL of a company’s careers or jobs page.

Scraping: The tool scrapes and extracts active job listings from the page.

Understanding: Using the Llama3.2 model, it analyzes the job descriptions to identify company needs.

Personalization: It pulls relevant case studies, project links, or portfolio items from the chroma vector database to match the specific job role.

Output: A personalized, high-impact cold email is generated — tailored to the company’s immediate hiring needs.

Use Case Scenario:
Nike is actively hiring a Principal Software Engineer, investing heavily in recruitment, onboarding, and training.

XYZ, a software development services company, sees an opportunity to help. Instead of letting Nike spend months hiring, XYZ's business development executive, John, uses this tool to:

Analyze Nike's job post,

Match it with XYZ's relevant past projects,

And generate a cold email offering a dedicated, experienced engineer ready to onboard immediately.

The result? A laser-targeted outreach email that positions XYZ as a fast, reliable solution — saving Nike time and resources.
